## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manasseh! 
Iâ€™m a senior software engineer with strong experience across the Banking, FinTech, and AdTech sectors leveraging Python, .NET, and cloud platforms such as Azure and Google Cloud. One of my core strengths is taking full ownership of my workâ€”I consistently go above and beyond to ensure my team and company succeed.
Iâ€™m also deeply passionate about continuous learning and growth. 

Iâ€™m currently sharpening my system design skills to build robust, high-performance architectures, and diving deeper into artificial intelligenceâ€”focusing on machine learning, LLMs.
